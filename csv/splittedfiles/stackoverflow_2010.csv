When you are interested in evaluating just one --known-- javascript function, it may be easier to implement this function in Python rather than pull in a huge tool that is built to parse and run all imaginable javascript in the world.</p> <p>So I would suggest to write a python version of the javascript unpacker function and most is solved. I did in fact do that and here is an example. The <code>int2base</code> function is Alex Martelli's implementation which can be found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2267362#2267446"">here</a>.</p> <pre><code>def unpack(p, a, c, k, e=None, d=None):     ''' unpack     Unpacker for the popular Javascript compression algorithm.          @param  p  template code     @param  a  radix for variables in p     @param  c  number of variables in p     @param  k  list of c variable substitutions     @param  e  not used     @param  d  not used     @return p  decompressed string     '''     # Paul Koppen, 2011     for i in xrange(c-1,-1,-1):         if k[i]: p = re.sub('\\b'+int2base(i,a)+'\\b', k[i], p)     return p </code></pre> <p>Finally you need to do a tiny bit of parsing to extract the four function arguments.

Being only somewhat skilled in both languages, Python feels nice and clean (although a little wierd) with the forced tabbing conventions and lack of semicolons. JS, on the other hand makes me feel like I need a shower. Especially after debugging in IE.</p>  <p>But the only real answer is the question - What do you want to do with it? Want to make websites do cool things in the browser? Go with JS. Something else? Maybe Python is better suited, as @Amber said.</p>  <p>Edit: As for getting up to speed, here's how it works. Your first language takes you a longer time to learn. Your second takes much less time, and after that it's not long at all since you're mostly just learning new syntax for similar things. So the solution for getting up to speed faster is to jump in right now.</p>"

If you want to make a website, for example, you'll have to learn both--JavaScript for the client and Python for the server.</p>  <p>Regardless, to answer your question, both languages are great but I'd say Python is easier to start with. JavaScript's basics are fine, but it features a lot of advanced concepts that you shouldn't have to deal with when learning your first language, IMO.</p>  <p><sup>1.

Server, gateway, framework? And how are you getting the <code>url</code> variable?</p>  <p>You appear to be getting a <a href=""https://wiki.python.org/moin/UnicodeEncodeError"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>UnicodeEncodeError</code></a>, which is about unexpected non-ASCII characters in the <em>input</em> to the <code>unquote</code> function, <em>not</em> an decoding problem at all. So I suggest that something has already decoded the path part of your URL to a Unicode string of some sort. Let's see the <code>repr</code> of that variable!</p>  <p>There are unfortunately a number of serious problems with several web servers that makes using Unicode in the pathname part of a URL very unreliable, not just in Python but generally.</p>  <p>The main problem is that the <code>PATH_INFO</code> variable is defined (by the CGI specification, and subsequently by WSGI) to be pre-decoded. This is a dreadful mistake partly because of issue (1) above, which means you can't get <code>%2F</code> in a path part, but more seriously because decoding a <code>%</code>-sequence  introduces a Unicode decode step that is out of the hands of the application. Server environments differ greatly in how non-ASCII <code>%</code>-escapes in the URL are handled, and it is often impossible to recreate the exact sequence of bytes that the web browser passed in.</p>  <p>IIS is a particular problem in that it will try to parse the URL path as UTF-8 by default, falling back to the wildly-unreliable system default codepage (eg. cp1252 on a Western Windows install) if the path isn't a valid UTF-8 sequence, but <em>without telling you</em>. You are then likely to have fairly severe problems trying to read any non-ASCII characters in <code>PATH_INFO</code> out of the environment variables map, because Windows envvars are Unicode but are accessed by Python 2 and many others as bytes in the system codepage.</p>  <p>Apache mitigates the problem by providing an extra non-standard environ <code>REQUEST_URI</code> that holds the original, completely undecoded URL submitted by the browser, which is easy to handle manually. However if you are using URL rewriting or error documents, that unmapped URL may not match what you thought it was going to be.</p>  <p>Some frameworks attempt to fix up these problems, with varying degrees of success. WSGI 1.1 is expected to make a stab at standardising this, but in the meantime the practical position we're left in is that Unicode paths won't work everywhere, and hacks to try to fix it on one server will typically break it on another.</p>  <p>You can always use URL rewriting to convert a Unicode path into a Unicode query parameter. Since the <code>QUERY_STRING</code> environ variable is not decoded outside of the application, it is much easier to handle predictably.</p>"

It's an easy language to pick up.  It's well documented.  It's associated with a large, active, and friendly community.

You can also build up from programming basics, starting by learning functions and then moving into classes.</p>  <p>Javascript is the bane of many a programmer's existences. It's easy enough to learn, and is good for small scripts which is what is was designed for. But once you start making anything big, it becomes hard to keep track of. That's why language modifications like <a href=""http://coffeescript.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href=""http://www.typescriptlang.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Typescript</a> and <a href=""http://dartlang.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dart</a> have emerged.</p>  <p>As noted by spinon, these programming languages were used in very different ways.

(See Crockford's <a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517748"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Javascript: the good parts</a> for a reasonable discussion by a JS expert and enthusiast about the good and bad parts thereof).  This might change if something like a <code>use strict;</code> directive ever makes its way into ECMAscript (though programming in ways that support old, and often buggy, browsers, will <em>still</em> be like pulling teeth -- like writing Python code that runs unchanged all the way from Python 1.0 to 3.1 would be!-).</p>  <p>Python is deployed in more traditional ways, so gradual language changes have enhanced it over the years (it was also designed with less hurry, and [[arguably, not ""a fact"";-)]] ended up with a better design from the start, in many respects).</p>  <p>As a result, Javascript (so far) has not enjoyed much success ""server side"", where programmers get a choice (even though they still have to use JS for ""browser side"" code). But there's nothing intrinsic to that.  JS is by far the most widely deployed language in the world (those billions of browsers...), huge investments are made in it by many companies and open source groups in competing implementations and supporting frameworks (Python's no slouch at that either, but the difference is still there), practical improvements (speed, warnings) keep piling up on JS's side as a consequence (even though the language proper can't improve).</p>  <p>With strict self-imposed programming discipline (enforced e.g. by Crockfor's ""lint"" program for JS) and a good supporting framework (jQuery, Dojo, Closure, ...) and tools (Firefox has maybe the best add-ons for JS tracing and debugging, but other browsers are rushing in that direction too), JS has become usable in recent years.  Probably one of these days a fast server-side implementation (probably with ""use strict;"" or the like enforced, once that's officially blessed;-) will start gaining a substantial foothold, just because so many web programmers already have some JS knowledge (they have to, to make good web apps).</p>  <p>Note that much of JS's bad rep (beyond the acknowledge ""bad parts that can't be removed"";-) comes from stuff that doesn't really ""belong"" to JS as a language: buggy implementations, the mess that the HTML DOM can often be (esp. with buggy browser impementations), etc.  There is no reason a future server-side deployment should reproduce these maddening defects!-)</p>"

This means that you can pass functions around, just like you can pass around any other value. The parentheses after the function name (the <code>()</code> in <code>myfunc()</code>) actually constitute an operator, just like <code>+</code> or <code>*</code>. Instead of meaning ""add this number to another number"" (in the case of <code>+</code>), <code>()</code> means ""execute the preceding function"". This is necessary because it is possible to use a function without executing it. For example, you may wish to compare it to another function using <code>==</code>, or you may wish to pass it into another function, such as in this JavaScript example:</p>  <pre><code>function alertSomething(message) {     alert(message); }  function myOtherFunction(someFunction, someArg) {    someFunction(someArg); }  // here we are using the alertSomething function without calling it directly myOtherFunction(alertSomething, ""Hello, araneae!"");  </code></pre>  <p>In short: it is important to be able to refer to a function without calling it — this is why the distinction is necessary.</p>"

First, Ruby returns <code>nil</code> in situations Python raises an exception:</p> <p>Accessing arrays and hashes:</p> <pre><code>[1, 2, 3][999] # nil. But [].fetch(0) raises an IndexError {&quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2}[&quot;nonexistent&quot;] # nil. But {}.fetch(&quot;nonexistent&quot;) raises an IndexError </code></pre> <p>Instance instance variables:</p> <pre><code>class MyClass   def hello     @thisdoesnotexist   end end  MyClass.new.hello #=&gt; nil </code></pre> <p>The second remarkable fact is that <code>nil</code> is an object with lots of methods. You can even convert it to an integer, float or string:</p> <pre><code>nil.to_i # 0 nil.to_f # 0.0 # But Integer(nil) or Float(nil) raise a TypeError. nil.to_s # &quot;&quot; </code></pre>"

There's a gem called <code>andand</code> that makes use of exactly this, so instead of something like </p>  <pre><code>@first_name &amp;&amp;= @first_name.trim </code></pre>  <p>you can write</p>  <pre><code>@first_name.andand.trim </code></pre>  <p>This basically translates to trim <code>@first_name</code> if it has a value other than <code>nil</code>, otherwise evaluate to <code>nil</code>. As you can imagine this is particularly useful when chaining methods where one of the intermediaries can potentially return <code>nil</code>.</p>  <p>Besides that <code>nil</code> is also returned when you are trying to access non-existing collection elements, e.g. in the case of arrays or hashes. Uninitialized instance variables also have the value <code>nil</code>.</p>  <p>I'm not overly versed in Python, but from what I've seen <code>nil</code> and <code>None</code> serve pretty much the same purpose.  </p>"

What you can do is encrypt your messages so that trapping them does not enable them to read what you're sending and receiving. In theory that's fine, but in practice you can't do modern crypto by hand even with the keys: you need to transfer some software too, and that's where it gets much more awkward.</p>  <p>You want to have the client's side of the crypto software locally, or at least enough to be able to check whether a digital signature of the crypto software is correct. Digital signatures are <em>very</em> difficult to forge. Deliver signed code, check its signature, and if the signature validates against a public key that you trust (alas, you'll have to transfer that out of band) then you know that the code (plus any CA certificates – trust roots – sent along with it) can be trusted to work as desired. The packets can then go over plain HTTP; they'll either get to where they're meant to or be intercepted, but either way nobody but the intended recipient will be able to read them. The <em>only</em> advantage of SSL is that it builds virtually all of this stuff for you and makes it easy.</p>  <p>I have no idea how practical it is to do this all in Javascript.

4258539	Detecting JavaScript on an HTML page using Python	javascript|python|html|security	2010-11-23 16:47:25.263000 UTC	"<p>I'm currently working on a network security project that checks for XSS vulnerabilities on a website, which hopefully can be used for pen-testers out there (in case you don't believe me and think I'm some kinda script kiddy, here's the class website: <a href=""http://netsec.cs.northwestern.edu/projects/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://netsec.cs.northwestern.edu/projects/</a>).</p>  <p>So, I'm having trouble detecting JavaScript on a given HTML page. I spent many hours installing PyV8 and V8 and it seems that they can evaluate simple JavaScript statements. However, for more 'complex' JavaScript problems, for example, an alert box, PyV8 does not seem to support it. So, I doubt if I can feed PyV8 some arbitrary JavaScript code and expect it to give me the corresponding JavaScript output.</p>  <p>I did find this JS server/client in DrEval but it doesn't seem to work in the latest revision of V8/PyV8.</p>  <p>Please help!

It can evaluate even the most complex javascript code. It is also being used by Google Chrome.</p>  <p>That being said, there are a few things you need to do to make it work properly. First of all, PyV8 is a <strong>javascript engine only</strong>. It does not construct the DOM. Thus, you need to create a DOM yourself and run the PyV8 context with it.</p>  <p>Also, you have said that the alert function does not work. The <code>alert();</code> function is part of the DOM, it is shorthand of <code>window.alert();</code>.

The problematic part of the python code is:</p>  <pre><code>htmlcode = """""" `&lt;head`&gt;  ## Heading ##     `&lt;title`&gt;PAROT - Report Options`&lt;/title`&gt;       `&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""FormChecks.js""`&gt;     `&lt;/script`&gt;  `&lt;/head`&gt; `&lt;body`&gt;     `&lt;form method=POST action=""cgiRunQuery.py""`&gt;""""""' </code></pre>  <p>When I send this to the server, it complains:</p>  <pre><code>tclogin1 - - [08/Dec/2010 10:55:02] ""GET /cgi-bin/FormChecks.js HTTP/1.1"" 200 - Traceback (most recent call last):   File ""/usr/lib/python2.6/CGIHTTPServer.py"", line 255, in run_cgi     os.execve(scriptfile, args, os.environ) OSError: [Errno 8] Exec format error tclogin1 - - [08/Dec/2010 10:55:02] CGI script exit status 0x7f00 </code></pre>  <p>It looks as though the python is trying to execute the JavaScript.  If I create a static html page containing the generated html code (including JavaScript), it all works fine.</p>"	4387607	"<p>Firstly. thanks all for taking the time to answer-</p>  <p>I had to but all the back ticks in or else Stack Overflow wouldn't display my HTML code.</p>  <p>If I remove the FormCheck.js from the cgi-bin directory, I get the following from the webserver:</p>  <p>tclogin1 - - [08/Dec/2010 12:42:17] ""POST /cgi-bin/cgiGetReportOptions.py HTTP/1.1"" 200 - tclogin1 - - [08/Dec/2010 12:42:17] code 404, message No such CGI script ('/cgi-bin/FormChecks.js') tclogin1 - - [08/Dec/2010 12:42:17] ""GET /cgi-bin/FormChecks.js HTTP/1.1"" 404 -</p>  <p>The server is seeing the</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""FormChecks.js""&gt; </code></pre>  <p>and for some reason trying to run the javascript file as CGI script</p>  <p>Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!</p>  <p>I've played around some more and the problem was:</p>  <pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/FormChecks.js""&gt; </code></pre>  <p>I was missing the ""/"" before FormChecks.js.</p>  <p>Thanks for all the suggestions - on to solving the next problem now :-)</p>"

Python programmers are not used to prototype inheritance and will probably not want to use it and you should be very carful when using metaclasses. Therefore I think it is best when you redisgn the inheritance model. I also think a redesign on the API wouldn't hurt to make it more pythonic.</p>"
4481451	Porting a JavaScript library to Python	javascript|python|inheritance|prototype|porting	2010-12-19 03:27:09.867000 UTC	"<p>I am interested in porting the <a href=""http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/"" rel=""nofollow"">protovis</a> javascript visualization library to python for use in scientific computing.  I have a general question and a specific one.</p>  <p>General: I have never ported a whole library before.  What are some good strategies?  Should I first just implement the user-facing API and then fill it in in a pythonic fashion?  Or is it better to try to port over the internals/infrastructure first, and then rebuild the API on top of it?</p>  <p>Specific: This library appears to make heavy use of javascript's prototype-based inheritance, which is somewhat different from the python model.  I found someone who made a pretty simple method to emulate <a href=""http://kashif.razzaqui.com/30414548"" rel=""nofollow"">prototypal-inheritance</a> in python.  However, from the perspective of porting a library, I'd rather not arm-twist python to be more like javascript.  Any feedback on this issue would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!</p>  <p>Uri</p>"	6415643	"<p>The Python ecosystem is currently lacking a visualization tool such as Protovis, go ahead and good luck with your rewrite!</p>"
