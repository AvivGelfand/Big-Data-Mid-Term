## You must show a "Proof of Work" for each question, even if there is no explicit output. 
## For example, a proof of work can be a printout/output that demonstrates that your command achieved the requirements. 

Remark: Before doing all the questions, we address the commas problem in the file. The file 
can be opened nicely in excel, but only after separating it using the command: 

> awk -F'"' -v OFS='"' '{ for (i=2; i<=NF; i+=2) gsub(",", "COMMAINSIDEQUOTES", $i) } 1' stackoverflow_javascript_python_qa.csv | sed "s/\,/\\t/g" | sed "s/COMMAINSIDEQUOTES/\,/g" > stackoverflow_javascript_python_qa_clean.csv

39960,Javascript equivalent of Python's locals()?,javascript|python,"<p>In Python one can get a dictionary of all local and global variables in the current scope with the built-in functions <code>locals()</code> and <code>globals()</code>.  Is there some equivalent way of doing this in Javascript?  For instance, I would like to do something like the following:</p>  <pre><code>var foo = function(){ alert('foo'); }; var bar = function(){ alert('bar'); };  var s = 'foo'; locals()[s](); // alerts 'foo' </code></pre>  <p>Is this at all possible, or should I just be using a local object for the lookup?</p>",39982,"<p>Well, I don't think that there is something like that in js. You can always use eval instead of locals(). Like this: </p>  <pre><code>eval(s+""()""); </code></pre>  <p>You just have to know that actually function <em>foo</em> exists.</p>  <p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>  <p>Don't use eval:) Use:</p>  <pre><code>var functionName=""myFunctionName""; window[functionName](); </code></pre>"

If you just want to check the existence of a given variable, you can do it by testing for it, something like this:</p>  <pre><code>if (foo) foo(); </code></pre>"

For example:</p>  <pre><code>function foo() {     var bar = function () {         alert('hello world');     };     var s = 'bar';     window[s](); // this won't work } </code></pre>  <p>In this case, s is 'bar', but the function 'bar' only exists inside the scope of the function 'foo'.  It is not defined in the window scope.</p>  <p>Of course, this doesn't really answer the original question, I just wanted to chime in on this response.  I don't believe there is a way to do what the original question asked.</p>"
