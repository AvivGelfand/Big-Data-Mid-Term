## You must show a "Proof of Work" for each question, even if there is no explicit output. 
## For example, a proof of work can be a printout/output that demonstrates that your command achieved the requirements. 

Remark: Before doing all the questions, we address the commas problem in the file. The file 
can be opened nicely in excel, but only after separating it using the command: 

> awk -F'"' -v OFS='"' '{ for (i=2; i<=NF; i+=2) gsub(",", "COMMAINSIDEQUOTES", $i) } 1' stackoverflow_javascript_python_qa.csv | sed "s/\,/\\t/g" | sed "s/COMMAINSIDEQUOTES/\,/g" > stackoverflow_javascript_python_qa_clean.csv
